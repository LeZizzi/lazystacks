# lazystacks
stacking clouds needs muscles. Including finger tips ,tendon etc so I put this lazy script on.I am assuming you got proxmox in a BOX any level 1 hypervisor ,can work on type 2 hypervisors but be prepared for dramatic panic error messages :D hyper-v is grand from a basic laptop with 4 GB of ram ,vmware is read only so sad trumpets ,xenserver is fine  ,has memory deduplication for a lab it's ideal and snappy cool to use has some .Net Framework management gizmos that can be tricky to run on linux(use Genymotion for Android emulator tends to bridge gaps. I dedicated 8 gb for workstation ,24 GB to run a in a fedora 29 basic kit called "Boxes" an ready to go live image packer that gets a vm ready only asking for a password.
